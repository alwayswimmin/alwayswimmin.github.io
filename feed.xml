finish the semester, giving me time to reflect a little bit and collect some
random thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zhuangzi's passage on the happiness of fish discusses the relativity of
knowledge: How does Zhuangzi know whether the fish are happy? But Huizi cannot
know what Zhuangzi knows… the cycle continues. Zhuangzi finishes with a play
on the word 安, which can mean either &quot;how&quot; or &quot;where.&quot; Last night, I read a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://paper-republic.org/lucasklein/anarchist-anthropology-happy-fish-and-translation/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; 
that focused on that last line, and I found both the post and its comment chain
enjoyable to peruse, comparing relativity of perspective to relativity of
location (hence 安 as &quot;whence&quot;) and the joy of philosophy to the playfulness of
fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago, a game of Catan ended in an interesting way: it was Will's
turn, and should Will end his turn it would be mine, and I would immediately
build a settlement with the resources in my hand and win the game. Andrew,
who almost has the resources to win himself, recognized that if he gave all of
his resources to Will, he could enable Will to win before me. Wishing to
prolong the game, he threatened to do so unless I forfeited the resources in my
hand that would have allowed me to win. I gave up my resources and was forced
to roll on my turn; I still got lucky with my roll, but I wonder if Andrew
could have strong-armed me further than he had done. Perhaps the game could
have been prolonged further if Andrew, Will, and I had entered an agreement to
give all of our resources to Rowen, who was far away in last place. My game of
Catan presented a similar situation to Risk, in which a player might threaten
to retaliate in full force against any invader, essentially sacking the current
game to win the metagame. This also leads me to wonder how much negative
expected value I would be willing to take on to prevent my opponents from
winning high positive expected value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classes are finally coming to a close. All classes build up in nature; the end
material rests on the foundation laid in the beginning. Yet I think I stand
more to learn at the end of this semester than at the end of my previous
semesters: Math 114 is entering Fourier analysis and exploring some familiar
results from complex analysis, like the maximum principle, in a real analysis
context (perhaps its original context); Stat 210 is covering the Central Limit
Theorem in more rigor; ER 18 is synthesizing all of the thinkers we'd covered
in the class; USW 35 is now proposing and discussing solutions to the problems
in our education system. Everything is coming together, but it's difficult to
keep track of everything, and truly, &lt;em&gt;tempus fugit&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Thanksgiving provides me with some well-needed rest before I jump back in to finish the semester, giving me time to reflect a little bit and collect some random thoughts.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">sicut cor ita cervus</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/posts/2017/10/30/cervus/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="sicut cor ita cervus" /><published>2017-10-31T09:30:00+07:00</published><updated>2017-10-31T09:30:00+07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/posts/2017/10/30/cervus</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/posts/2017/10/30/cervus/">&lt;p&gt;I knew I belonged in Harvard Glee Club when we sang a TTBB arrangement of
Palestrina's &lt;em&gt;Sicut cervus&lt;/em&gt; at the first rehearsal freshman year. The text is
an adaptation of Psalm 42:&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sicut cervus desiderat ad fontes aquarum, ita
desiderat anima mea ad te, Deus&lt;/em&gt;. The sheet music we were using had a typo in
the English translation, using &lt;em&gt;heart&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;hart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; as the translation
for &lt;em&gt;cervus&lt;/em&gt;. Interestingly, just as &lt;em&gt;hart&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;heart&lt;/em&gt; sound similar, so do
&lt;em&gt;cervus&lt;/em&gt; and the Latin word for &lt;em&gt;heart&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;cor&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and even more
interestingly, this is not a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two words in each language sound similar because they are derived from
words that sound similar in Proto-Indo-European. &lt;em&gt;Heart&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;cor&lt;/em&gt; are derived
from PIE &lt;em&gt;*ḱḗr&lt;/em&gt; (oblique stem &lt;em&gt;*ḱr̥d-&lt;/em&gt;), which is well-attested across the many
branches of Indo-European; another familiar example is Greek &lt;em&gt;kardiá&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The
relationship between &lt;em&gt;heart&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;cor&lt;/em&gt; is unexceptional to anyone with exposure
to PIE. Less commonly known is the corresponding relationship between &lt;em&gt;hart&lt;/em&gt;
and &lt;em&gt;cervus&lt;/em&gt;, both rarer words in their respective languages. &lt;em&gt;Hart&lt;/em&gt; is derived
from PIE &lt;em&gt;*ḱerh₂-&lt;/em&gt; (&quot;horn&quot;),&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which is also the source of &lt;em&gt;cervus&lt;/em&gt;.  We see
that &lt;em&gt;*ḱḗr&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;*ḱerh₂-&lt;/em&gt; sound similar, and by regularity of sound change,&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
words derived from similar-sounding roots in the proto-language will continue
to sound similar in daughter languages, which resulted in the confusion in the
English translation of &lt;em&gt;Sicut cervus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

individual and employer mandates from the Affordable Care Act. By removing the
requirement for people to have insurance, Republicans tout this bill as
restoring choice to the American consumer, thereby reducing healthcare prices.
This sounds like music in a speech: health insurance providers still can't
discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions, but now consumers are
not forced to pay for insurance they don't want! This seems like a double-win
for the American people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the catch: not only will a skinny repeal not lower costs, it's actually
much worse than having Obamacare repealed entirely.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
I wish I had more time to do more research and flesh out all the statistics and
details, since health care is such a crucial topic in today's age, but our
government, so insistent on pushing repeal through as a political move,
compelled a quick response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obamacare's monumental achievement was to lower healh care costs to the most
vulnerable. Some people are at greater risk of disease than others: this has
held true in the past and will continue to be true for the foreseeable future.
People with different genetics, different lifestyles, and different previous
illnesses face different likelihoods of falling ill in the future. We can get a
sense of consumer behavior through a simple model: at period 1, say one half of
the population has a 20% chance and the other half of the population has an 80%
chance of falling ill in period 2. Let's also suppose that, without insurance,
a consumer pays $0 when healthy and $1000 when ill in period 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-Obamacare, people with the highest risk faced the highest insurance
premiums, and people with the lowest risk faced the lowest. Insurance is not
inherently a transfer from the low-risk to the high-risk; it is a means for
each individual person to hedge their bets. Almost everyone is risk-averse to
some degree: given a choice between $500 guaranteed or a 50% chance at $1000, I
think most people would choose the guaranteed money. Insurance is precisely
this. An insurance company, by aggregating independent probabilities, can
stabilize risk for everyone. Before the Affordable Care Act, the fair insurance
rate for low-risk individuals is to pay $200 and for high-risk individuals to
pay $800 in period 1. Because individuals are risk-averse, both low- and
high-risk individuals are happy with this plan. By discrimination, insurance
companies can set fair prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that oftentimes individuals find themselves at a high risk
of disease at no fault of their own because of bad luck previously in life or
even before birth. A core idea behind Obamacare is to share health care costs
across all individuals, irrespective of high or low risk levels. Democrats
justified this with a plea for fairness: it's largely not a high-risk
individual's fault that they are more likely to fall ill. Republicans oppose
this also on the grounds of fairness: it's not the responsibility of the
low-risk individual to have to pay for the high-risk individual's bad luck,
either. My purpose here is not to convince the reader one way or another on
this issue, but merely that skinny repeal is a strictly worse option than both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post-Obamacare, insurance companies can no longer discriminate on pre-existing
conditions. In our model, this means that insurance companies set a single
price for both high- and low-risk individuals. However, Obamacare also includes
an individual mandate: all individuals must buy insurance. Knowing that all
individuals must buy insurance, companies will set the fair price of $500 for
everyone. This is a great deal for high-risk individuals, since they are now
paying much lower than they would have without Obamacare. Low-risk individuals
now must pay more than they are willing, but they must buy the insurance anyway
to subsidize the high-risk individuals' health care. Behind the veil of
ignorance, prior to knowing risk level, paying $500 is perfectly fair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trouble comes when we remove the individual mandate, but leave insurance
companies unable to discriminate. Let's suppose the insurance company sets its
price at $500 as before. The high-risk individuals will all buy this plan, but
none of the low-risk individuals will buy it. In this scenario, the insurance
company will lose money, so it will certainly not set its price at $500, or
indeed, any price less than $800.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the price settles at $800, high-risk individuals will pay the same amount
as without Obamacare, but low-risk individuals will be left entirely uninsured,
which is a strictly worse outcome than without Obamacare at all assuming
risk-aversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are even worse with more complicated models than my simple
two-state, two-period example. In the real world, people have all different
probabilities of falling ill. It follows fairly easily from the simple model
that insurance companies will only charge the fair price of the individuals at
greatest risk, since at any other price, they will lose money. As we spread
more and more people across this continuum of illness risk, we see that more
and more people are left without access to insurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banning price discrimination without an individual mandate, then, is
essentially a ban on health care insurance entirely. Despite making for a great
sound bite, skinny repeal is an incredibly irresponsible and damaging political
maneuver, and if it is enacted, skinny repeal is far, far worse for the
American people than full repeal.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Today, Republicans announced the Health Care Freedom Act, notably removing the individual and employer mandates from the Affordable Care Act.

extent can the government take that away? Last week, Jacob and I were
discussing whether the government has done too little or too much in shaping
our life decisions. The United States gives its citizens plenty of agency in
weighing the short and long term. I can choose what food I eat and how much I
exercise, as it's entirely my decision whether having a satisfying but
unhealthy lifestyle is worth shaving years off the end of my life. I assess
risk constantly, from inching closer to the edge of a cliff for that perfect
photo to simply biking to and from work, internalizing the probability that I
get into an accident. I can choose my career: some jobs are more financially
risky while some are physically more dangerous, some better fit my skill set
while others I find more intrinsically appealling, but the government leaves
all of these factors up to the market to set prices and wages, and from there I
make my own choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in plenty of other instances, we don't get too much say in our future.
Although I make the decision to hit the road, once I do, I must wear a seat
belt. The government compels us into Social Security, essentially forcing us to
prepare for retirement.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Suicide is perhaps the most extreme expression of
determining one's fate, but suicide historically has been illegal and is
sometimes considered a common law crime, while medically assisted suicide is
strictly illegal in all but six states.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; There's plenty to be said about
whether the government should regulate one's decisions that only affect
oneself in generality, but for the sake of this post we'll focus mostly on
those decisions regarding end of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;valuing-tomorrow&quot;&gt;Valuing Tomorrow&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I think it's necessary to establish why I value my future. I value my
own well-being, which encompasses pleasure and pain in both the present and the
future, and I value others' well-being, especially those I care for, like my
family. The former is primarily self-interested: I desire pleasure and I avoid
harm. The latter informs broader decisions I make: what I want out of my
studies, my future career, and so on. While I do derive fulfillment from
bettering the lives of those around me, and economists do lump all aspects of
decision-making under the notion of utility, for the sake of this discussion it
is useful to separate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does utility over time and intertemporal choice look like? We tend to
value consumption in the present more than consumption in the future. Given a
piece of candy that can be consumed today or five years from now, it's
reasonable to consume today. On the other hand, painful tasks like chores
tend to be pushed back to the future. Economists model this behavior using
discounting of future utility. The simplest model involves a parameter
\(\delta \in [0,1)\), where we make decisions that maximize
\[U := u_1 + \delta \mathop{\rm E}[u_2],\]
where \(u_1\) is utility derived from consumption in the first period (the
present) and \(\mathop{\rm E}[u_2]\) is the expected second period utility
(the future).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of \(u_1\) and \(u_2\) can then be separated into the two components
discussed earlier; we can write \(u_i(s_i,o_i)\) as an increasing function of
well-being \(s_i\) of oneself and \(o_i\) of others. Choices that either better
my personal life without impacting others or better others without impacting
myself are strictly good, for example. Those that better myself at the cost of
others or better others but demand sacrifice from me are more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to suddenly die painlessly in my sleep, there would be limited
loss to my personal well-being. I would go to bed the previous night
unsuspecting and happy as always, expecting the next day and the combination
of joy and hurt it brings, only I would not actually experience it. Given a
choice, however, I very much want to go to bed tonight waking up tomorrow. I
want to experience \(s_2\), since my current decision maximizes \(U\) which
is increasing in \(s_2\). I partly want to live the future for myself. But I
also care about \(o_2\). If I were to die, I think \(o_2\) takes an even
greater hit than \(s_2\). Death to me seems like a neutral thing, and I would
die not feeling any pain, but those that care about me would suffer loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determining what I value and why is a very hard question. I've written what I
consider to be a crude but fairly accurate model, at least at the time of
writing, but I fully expect that as my blog and I mature, my views on this
particular issue to change and develop more than most of my other beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;suicide&quot;&gt;Suicide&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legality of suicide is certainly a very difficult matter, and it's very
reasonable to default to laws that preserve life. But to what extent should
suicide really be regulated by the government?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I unequivocally believe that I have a personal responsibility to help people with
suicidal thoughts and encourage them to seek therapy. Someone who chooses
suicide implicitly finds life tomorrow not worth living, but I believe that
with proper help, they will find that life tomorrow has so much more
fulfillment than they had expected the day before. In this case, the skewed
perceived expectation of the future \(\mathop{\rm E}_*[u_2]\) is drastically
out of line with the actual expected value of future utility 
\(\mathop{\rm E}[u_2]\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this rationalization leads me to believe that I ought to do everything in
my power to save lives, I have a hard time deciding whether or not it is
grounds for the government to forcibly intervene. My inclination is that it is
generally not the government's role to determine whether or not an adult's
utility function is &quot;rational,&quot; or whether a future self would regret taking a
particular action. Nevertheless, it still makes perfect sense for the
government to limit the actions of children, so I'm not ready to make any
general statement here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;death-with-dignity&quot;&gt;Death with Dignity&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, if someone were terminally ill and knew that for the rest of their
short life, they would be in excruciating pain, they ought to have the right to
escape pain gracefully. Perhaps the most well-known case of this today is that
of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany_Maynard&quot;&gt;Brittany Maynard&lt;/a&gt;, who
moved to Oregon to end her life in 2014 following a terminal brain cancer
diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is perfectly rational, in that 
\(\mathop{\rm E}_*[u_2] \approx \mathop{\rm E}[u_2]\) is actually a
reasonable representation of actual utility in the future. Using my simplified
value heuristic, prolonged pain harms personal well-being, and terminal illness
harms capability of improving others' well-being. The degree to which disease
impacts these values varies person by person, so while I think everyone in such
a position ought to have the right to death with dignity, I certainly don't
mean to imply that death by dignity is a path that people in this situation
should always take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A natural extension to consider is removing the stipulation of pain. If someone
had a terminal illness that didn't cause any bodily pain, but otherwise
incapacitated me, e.g. loss of memory or paralysis, then I think death with
dignity should still be granted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;euthanasia-and-death-as-a-prior-arrangement&quot;&gt;Euthanasia and Death as a Prior Arrangement&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Euthanasia is slightly different from physician-assisted suicide. In assisted
suicide, a doctor prescribes lethal medication, and the agent self-administers
that medication when desired. In euthanasia, the agent might be unable to
self-administer; for example, they might be too weak to swallow the medication.
Euthanasia contrasts from physician-assisted suicide in that it is entirely
illegal in all the United States, despite the legality of physician-assisted
suicide in some states.  Euthanasia is only legal in a handful of countries in
the world, with the Netherlands and Belgium as notable examples.  Despite the
differences in legality, which I'll discuss in the next section, I don't find
anything morally different between these situations: one person wishes for
death, and another person complies, ensuring that death comes exactly as the
patient wishes it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What separates euthanasia from physician-assisted suicide is that an agent can
potentially enter a contract to be put down in the future, since the agent does
not need to be the one administering the medicine at the time of death. Playing
with timing makes euthanasia questionable. We allow people to opt into organ
donation programs, where in the event of brain death, their organs can be
harvested. It initially doesn't seem like an unreasonable leap to stipulate
that, in the future, should a disease or freak accident cause me to permanently
lose my memory and rational thought, though not quite leave brain dead, I give
up my body for organ donation. Perhaps this injury causes me to lash out
violently and mindlessly against everyone, including those I previously loved.
Or perhaps I know that my disease will result in the eventual loss of my
ability to think. It seems fair for the current me to agree to put this
potential future me down, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is quite troubling. What if in the future I don't want to die, even
though my present self willed it? Are the present and future selves the same
person? Indeed, in the present, it is precisely because I consider the future
me to be a different person whose values would not align with mine that I
agreed to have myself put down in the first place. This is surprisingly similar
to the intertemporal mindset of a saved suicidal person: in period 1, the agent
determines that living in period 2 is unfulfilling, but in period 2, the agent
then wants to live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that in this example, the period 1 agent should not be allowed to
enter a contract that may result in the unwilling death of the period 2 self.
We certainly should not kill someone who is unwilling just because we think it
is for the better: this seems pretty clear to me to be murder. Should the
period 1 self not wish to grant the period 2 agent control of their body, then
they must take proactive action in period 1 rather than enter a contract to
have themselves killed in the future.  Consequently, to be eligible for
euthanasia, I believe that an agent must desire it at the time of
administration, not at some previous time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;contrasting-with-current-laws&quot;&gt;Contrasting with Current Laws&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, I find not trying to prevent medically assisted suicide more
moral than not trying to prevent a normal suicide, though current laws indicate
that the government believes the opposite, as physician-assisted suicide is
more explicit in its illegality in more states. Note also that in almost all
circumstances, we allow people to refuse life-saving medical treatment.
Choosing to die painlessly seems strictly better than dying painfully without
any medication at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I find euthanasia only proper when the patient desires death at the
moment it is administered, I find euthanasia more justifiably illegal, as the
cases where euthanasia is most applicable are also those where the patient is
most vulnerable and incapacitated. Our legal system hinges on responsibility:
granting doctors the right to terminate their patients, even with the consent
of the patient, opens up room for abuse. If, for example, only verbal consent
at the time of administration were required for euthanasia to be justified,
then even with witnesses, determining whether a doctor conducted themself
within the law is difficult. If we require written consent, then presumably the
patient is capable of administering the medicine themself anyway, so only
physician-assisted suicide is necessary. Morally, I think that there's no
difference between written, verbal, or any other means of consent, but I
understand that legally it may be necessary to distinguish them. The intent of
the patient is much more clear in assisted suicide than in euthanasia, and our
laws must err on the side of patient protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I think it's worth contrasting legislation meant strictly to protect your future self from your current self from most legislation, whose primary purpose is to restrict your actions to benefit other people. Seat belt laws are meant mostly to restrain you to keep you safe, as wearing a seat belt has minimal positive externalities of the safety of other drivers. Social Security is less clear, since it can be seen as a redistribution of income from the young to the old, but over a lifetime it largely does not redistribute income from the rich to the poor, so I think it's better to classify Social Security as a compulsory retirement plan rather than income redistribution. On the other hand, while Obamacare forces us to buy health insurance, the primary purpose of this is not to babysit us. The individual mandate's main purpose is to spread the cost of healthcare across the entire country to make the other key provision, banning price discrimination based on pre-existing conditions, feasible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, the five states with legislation allowing death with dignity are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deathwithdignity.org/learn/death-with-dignity-acts/&quot;&gt;Oregon since 1998, Vermont since 2013, Washington since 2009, and California and Colorado since 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Montana allows for death with dignity via a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baxter_v._Montana&quot;&gt;court ruling in 2009&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Last week, Jacob and I were discussing whether the government has done too little or too much in shaping our life decisions. The United States gives its citizens plenty of agency in weighing the short and long term. I can choose what food I eat and how much I exercise, as it's entirely my decision whether having a satisfying but unhealthy lifestyle is worth shaving years off the end of my life. I assess risk constantly, from inching closer to the edge of a cliff for that perfect photo to simply biking to and from work, internalizing the probability that I get into an accident. I can choose my career: some jobs are more financially risky while some are physically more dangerous, some better fit my skill set while others I find more intrinsically appealling, but the government leaves all of these factors up to the market to set prices and wages, and from there I make my own choice.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Egorychev, Part 2</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/posts/2017/07/15/egorychev-2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Egorychev, Part 2" /><published>2017-07-16T11:30:00+07:00</published><updated>2017-07-16T11:30:00+07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/posts/2017/07/15/egorychev-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/posts/2017/07/15/egorychev-2/">&lt;p&gt;Ross sent me an interesting math problem last month, and I detailed my attempt
at a solution in a &lt;a href=&quot;/jekyll/posts/2017/07/06/egorychev/&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; a little
more than a week ago. With his substantial help, I was finally able to make
some headway, and the following solution is much more a recreation of his
rather than my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let \(0 \le a &amp;lt; 1\) and \(n \in \mathbb{Z}^+\), and define
\[ I_n = \left( 1-a^2 \right)^{n-1/2} \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{d\theta}{\left( 1 + a\cos\theta \right)^n}. \]
Express \(I_n\) as a polynomial in \(a\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my earlier post, the reader should mind two key insights
using complex analysis: the first, a treatment of \(\cos\theta\) I'd dealt
with regularly, and the second, the Egorychev method, which I hadn't yet
encountered. The beginning of the solution is much the same, so one who has
already read my previous post on this problem can comfortably skip through the
first steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first get rid of the integral as quickly as possible and worry about
simplifying later, applying a standard substitution of \(z = e^{i\theta}\),
transforming the real integral into a complex one. We then have 
\(\cos\theta = \frac{1}{2} \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right)\) and 
\(dz = iz \,d\theta\), and the integral becomes
\[ \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{d\theta}{\left( 1 + a\cos\theta \right)^n} = \oint_{\lvert z \rvert=1} \frac{1}{iz} \frac{dz}{\left( 1 + \frac{a}{2} \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \right)^n}. \]
If \(a = 0\), \(I_n = 2\pi\) immediately; otherwise, we have
\begin{align}
&amp;amp;\phantom{ {}={} } \oint_{\lvert z \rvert=1} \frac{1}{iz} \frac{dz}{\left( 1 + \frac{a}{2} \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \right)^n} \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{1}{i} \oint_{\lvert z \rvert=1} \frac{z^{n-1} \,dz}{\left( \frac{a}{2} z^2 + z + \frac{a}{2} \right)^n} \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{1}{i} \left( \frac{2}{a} \right)^n \oint_{\lvert z \rvert=1} \frac{z^{n-1} \,dz}{\left( \left( z - \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1-a^2}}{a} \right) \left( z - \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1-a^2}}{a} \right) \right)^n} \\
&amp;amp;= 2\pi \left( \frac{2}{a} \right)^n \frac{1}{(n-1)!} \left. \frac{d^{n-1}}{dz^{n-1}} \left( \frac{z^{n-1}}{\left( z - \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1-a^2}}{a} \right)^n } \right) \right\rvert_{z = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1-a^2}}{a}},
\end{align}
by Cauchy's integral formula. For the sake of simplifying notation, we
substitute \(w = z - \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1-a^2}}{a}\), giving us
\begin{align}
&amp;amp;\phantom{ {}={} } 2\pi \left( \frac{2}{a} \right)^n \frac{1}{(n-1)!} \left. \frac{d^{n-1}}{dz^{n-1}} \left( \frac{z^{n-1}}{\left( z - \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1-a^2}}{a} \right)^n } \right) \right\rvert_{z = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1-a^2}}{a}} \\
&amp;amp;= 2\pi \left( \frac{2}{a} \right)^n \frac{1}{(n-1)!} \left. \frac{d^{n-1}}{dw^{n-1}} \left( \frac{\left(w + \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1-a^2}}{a} \right)^{n-1}}{ w^n } \right) \right\rvert_{w = \frac{2\sqrt{1-a^2}}{a}} \\
&amp;amp;= 2\pi \left( \frac{2}{a} \right)^n \frac{1}{(n-1)!} \left. \frac{d^{n-1}}{dw^{n-1}} \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{k} \left( \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1-a^2}}{a} \right)^k w^{-k-1} \right) \right\rvert_{w = \frac{2\sqrt{1-a^2}}{a}} \\
&amp;amp;= 2\pi \left( \frac{2}{a} \right)^n \frac{1}{(n-1)!} \left. \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{k} \frac{(-1)^{n-1} (n-1+k)!}{k!} \left( \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1-a^2}}{a} \right)^k w^{-k-n} \right\rvert_{w = \frac{2\sqrt{1-a^2}}{a}} \\
&amp;amp;= 2\pi \left( \frac{2}{a} \right)^n (-1)^{n-1} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{(n-1+k)!}{k!k!(n-1-k)!} \left( \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1-a^2}}{a} \right)^k \left( \frac{2\sqrt{1-a^2}}{a} \right)^{-k-n} \\
&amp;amp;= 2\pi (-1)^{n-1} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{(n-1+k)!}{k!k!(n-1-k)!} \left( \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1-a^2}}{2} \right)^k \left( \sqrt{1-a^2} \right)^{-k-n}.
\end{align}
We then have
\begin{align}
I_n &amp;amp;= \left( \sqrt{1-a^2} \right)^{2n-1} 2\pi (-1)^{n-1} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{(n-1+k)!}{k!k!(n-1-k)!} \left( \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1-a^2}}{2} \right)^k \left( \sqrt{1-a^2} \right)^{-k-n} \\
&amp;amp;= 2\pi (-1)^{n-1} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{(n-1+k)!}{k!k!(n-1-k)!} \left( -\frac{1 + \sqrt{1-a^2}}{2} \right)^k \left( \sqrt{1-a^2} \right)^{n-1-k}.
\end{align}
Again, for the sake of simplifying notation, let \(x = \sqrt{1-a^2}\). Notice
that there very well may be terms of odd powers of \(x\), so we have no
indication yet that the resulting value will end up being a polynomial in
\(a\). We then have
\begin{align}
&amp;amp;\phantom{ {}={} } 2\pi (-1)^{n-1} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{(n-1 + k)!}{k!k!(n-1 - k)!} \left( -\frac{1 + x}{2} \right)^k x^{n-1 - k} \\
&amp;amp;= 2\pi \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \sum_{j=0}^k \frac{(n-1 + k)!}{k! (n-1 - k)! j! (k - j)!} (-2)^{-k} x^{n-1 - j}.
\end{align}
This is a minor change from my previous solution. We expand 
\( \left( \frac{1 + x}{2} \right)^k = \sum_{j=0}^k \binom{k}{j} \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^{k-j} \) 
rather than using \(j\) as the exponent; this avoids some annoying
reindexing, as the resulting exponent of \(x\) in the double sum depends only
on \(j\) rather than a combination. Swapping the sums gives
\begin{align}
&amp;amp;\phantom{ {}={} } 2\pi \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \sum_{j=0}^k \frac{(n-1 + k)!}{k! (n-1 - k)! j! (k - j)!} (-2)^{-k} x^{n-1 - j} \\
&amp;amp;= 2\pi \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1 - j} \sum_{k=j}^{n-1} \frac{(n-1 + k)!}{k! (n-1 - k)! j! (k - j)!} (-2)^{-k} \\
&amp;amp;= 2\pi \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1 - j} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1 + k}{k - j} \binom{n-1 + j}{n-1} \binom{n-1}{k} (-2)^{-k} \\
&amp;amp;= 2\pi \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1 - j} \binom{n-1 + j}{n-1} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1 + k}{k - j} \binom{n-1}{k} (-2)^{-k},
\end{align}
where we extend the sum over \(k\) to start at \(0\), as terms where 
\(k &amp;lt; j\) are \(0\) anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we apply the Egorychev method. Up until this point I'd been in a mad dash
to get rid of the integral as quickly as possible, and then simplify as much as
possible, but then I was blocked by a binomial sum I couldn't handle. The
Egorychev method involves introducing complex contour integrals to simplify
binomial identities, which seems a little backwards – after all, didn't we
just work so hard to get rid of a contour integral in the first place? Well,
let's see what this method really does.
Our main tool is the following identity:
\[
\binom{s}{t} = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{\lvert z \rvert = \varepsilon} \frac{(1+z)^s \,dz}{z^{t+1}}
\]
There are other possible integrals we could use to express binomials, but this
will suffice for this problem. My main intuition here for why we would ever
want to substitute this is that binomials are nice in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each individual binomial is pretty arithmetically: 
\(\binom{s}{t} = \frac{s!}{t!(s-t)!}\).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Binomials combine to be pretty algebraically: 
\(\sum_{t=0}^s \binom{s}{t}z^t = (1+z)^s\) is the simplest example, and we
can think of generating functions more generally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are nice ways combinatorially to think about binomials using both these
facts simultaneously, but here we're stuck with individual binomials in a sum
that doesn't allow them to play nicely off of each other, especially because of
this nasty \( (-2)^{n-1 - k} \) term. We'd like to be able to take advantage
of property 2, which is what the Egorychev method affords us. Applying the
method to the binomial \(\binom{n-1 + k}{k - j}\) gives us
\begin{align}
&amp;amp;\phantom{ {}={} } \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1 + k}{k - j} \binom{n-1}{k} (-2)^{-k} \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2\pi i} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \oint_{\lvert z \rvert = \varepsilon} \frac{(1+z)^{n-1 + k} \,dz}{z^{k - j + 1}} \binom{n-1}{k} (-2)^{-k} \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{\lvert z \rvert = \varepsilon} \frac{(1+z)^{n-1}}{z^{-j + 1}} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{k} \left( -\frac{1}{2z} - \frac{1}{2} \right)^k \,dz \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{\lvert z \rvert = \varepsilon} \frac{(1+z)^{n-1}}{z^{n-1 - j + 1}} \left( -\frac{1}{2z} + \frac{1}{2} \right)^{n-1} \,dz \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{\lvert z \rvert = \varepsilon} \frac{\left( 1 - z^2 \right)^{n-1} \,dz}{z^{n-1 - j + 1}} \\
&amp;amp;= \begin{cases} 0 &amp;amp; 2 \not\mid n-1 - j \\ \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \binom{n-1}{(n-1 - j)/2} (-1)^{(n-1 - j)/2} &amp;amp; 2 \mid n-1 - j. \end{cases}
\end{align}
Now let \(k' = \frac{n-1 - j}{2}\). We can then write
\begin{align}
&amp;amp;\phantom{ {}={} } 2\pi \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1 - j} \binom{n-1 + j}{n-1} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1 + k}{k - j} \binom{n-1}{k} (-2)^{-k} \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{2\pi}{2^{n-1}} \sum_{k'=0}^{n-1} x^{2k'} \binom{2(n-1) - 2k'}{n-1} \binom{n-1}{k'} (-1)^{k'} \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{2\pi}{2^{n-1}} \sum_{k'=0}^{n-1} \binom{2(n-1) - 2k'}{n-1} \binom{n-1}{k'} (-1)^{k'} \left( 1 - a^2 \right)^{k'},
\end{align}
which is indeed a polynomial in \(a\). Expanding once more and swapping the
sums, we have
\begin{align}
&amp;amp;\phantom{ {}={} } \frac{2\pi}{2^{n-1}} \sum_{k'=0}^{n-1} \binom{2(n-1) - 2k'}{n-1} \binom{n-1}{k'} (-1)^{k'} \left( 1 - a^2 \right)^{k'} \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{2\pi}{2^{n-1}} \sum_{k'=0}^{\lfloor (n-1)/2 \rfloor} \binom{2(n-1) - 2k'}{n-1} \binom{n-1}{k'} (-1)^{k'} \sum_{m=0}^{k'} \binom{k'}{m} (-1)^m a^{2m} \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{2\pi}{2^{n-1}} \sum_{m=0}^{\lfloor (n-1)/2 \rfloor} (-1)^m a^{2m} \sum_{k'=m}^{\lfloor (n-1)/2 \rfloor} \binom{2(n-1) - 2k'}{n-1} \binom{n-1}{k'} \binom{k'}{m} (-1)^{k'} \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{2\pi}{2^{n-1}} \sum_{m=0}^{\lfloor (n-1)/2 \rfloor} (-1)^m a^{2m} \sum_{k'=m}^{\lfloor (n-1)/2 \rfloor} \binom{2(n-1) - 2k'}{n-1} \binom{n-1}{m} \binom{n-1 - m}{k' - m} (-1)^{k'} \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{2\pi}{2^{n-1}} \sum_{m=0}^{\lfloor (n-1)/2 \rfloor} (-1)^m a^{2m} \binom{n-1}{m} \sum_{k'=m}^{\lfloor (n-1)/2 \rfloor} \binom{2(n-1) - 2k'}{n-1} \binom{n-1 - m}{k' - m} (-1)^{k'}.
\end{align}
We now use the Egorychev method again to the binomial 
\(\binom{2(n-1) - 2k'}{n-1}\):
\begin{align}
&amp;amp;\phantom{ {}={} } \sum_{k'=m}^{\lfloor (n-1)/2 \rfloor} \binom{2(n-1) - 2k'}{n-1} \binom{n-1 - m}{k' - m} (-1)^{k'} \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \sum_{k'=m}^{\lfloor (n-1)/2 \rfloor} \oint_{\lvert z \rvert = \varepsilon} \frac{(1+z)^{2(n-1) - 2k'} \,dz}{z^n} \binom{n-1 - m}{k' - m} (-1)^{k'} \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2 \pi i} (-1)^m \oint_{\lvert z \rvert = \varepsilon} \frac{1}{z^n} \sum_{k'=m}^{\lfloor (n-1)/2 \rfloor} \binom{n-1 - m}{k' - m} \left( 1 + 2z + z^2 \right)^{n-1 - k'} (-1)^{k' - m} \,dz \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2 \pi i} (-1)^m \oint_{\lvert z \rvert = \varepsilon} \frac{1}{z^n} \left( 2z + z^2 \right)^{n-1 - m} \,dz \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2 \pi i} (-1)^m \oint_{\lvert z \rvert = \varepsilon} \frac{(2 + z)^{n-1 - m} \,dz}{z^{m + 1}} \\
&amp;amp;= (-1)^m 2^{n-1 - 2m} \binom{n-1 - m}{m}.
\end{align}
Finishing, we have
\begin{align}
I_n &amp;amp;= \frac{2\pi}{2^{n-1}} \sum_{m=0}^{\lfloor (n-1)/2 \rfloor} (-1)^m a^{2m} \binom{n-1}{m} \sum_{k'=m}^{\lfloor (n-1)/2 \rfloor} \binom{2(n-1) - 2k'}{n-1} \binom{n-1 - m}{k' - m} (-1)^{k'} \\
I_n &amp;amp;= \frac{2\pi}{2^{n-1}} \sum_{m=0}^{\lfloor (n-1)/2 \rfloor} (-1)^m a^{2m} \binom{n-1}{m} (-1)^m 2^{n-1 - 2m} \binom{n-1 - m}{m} \\
I_n &amp;amp;= 2\pi \sum_{m=0}^{\lfloor (n-1)/2 \rfloor}\binom{n-1}{m} \binom{n-1 - m}{m} \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^{2m}.
\end{align}
This end result is very nice. The general strategy in this problem centered
around simplifying sums of the form 
\(\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{s}{t} \binom{n}{k} c^k\), where the first binomial
was manipulated using Egorychev, and the resulting exponential combines with
the second binomial to simplify the sum.  The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egorychev_method&quot;&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt; on
the Egorychev method highlights some examples of more complicated uses of the
method, using more than just one integral at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Ross noted to me that this integral actually has applications in
physics: &quot;this integral actually comes out of computing the time averages
\(\left\langle r^n \right\rangle\) of a Kepler orbit

neat trick called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egorychev_method&quot;&gt;Egorychev method&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let \(0 \le a &amp;lt; 1\) and \(n \in \mathbb{Z}^+\), and define
\[ I_n = \left( 1-a^2 \right)^{n-1/2} \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{d\theta}{\left( 1 + a\cos\theta \right)^n}. \]
Express \(I_n\) as a polynomial in \(a\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't completely simplified the end polynomial (note: a full solution can
be found in a &lt;a href=&quot;/jekyll/posts/2017/07/15/egorychev-2/&quot;&gt;newer blog post&lt;/a&gt;), but
the key insights using complex analysis – the first, a treatment of
\(\cos\theta\) I'd dealt with regularly, and the second, the Egorychev
method, which I hadn't yet encountered – are present and worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My intuition was to get rid of the integral as quickly as possible and worry
about simplifying later. I therefore immediately applied a standard
substitution of \(z = e^{i\theta}\), transforming the real integral into a
complex one. We then have 
\(\cos\theta = \frac{1}{2} \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right)\) 
and \(dz = iz \,d\theta\), and the integral becomes
\[ \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{d\theta}{\left( 1 + a\cos\theta \right)^n} = \oint_{\lvert z \rvert=1} \frac{1}{iz} \frac{dz}{\left( 1 + \frac{a}{2} \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \right)^n}. \]
If \(a = 0\), \(I_n = 2\pi\) immediately; otherwise, we have
\begin{align}
&amp;amp;\phantom{ {}={} } \oint_{\lvert z \rvert=1} \frac{1}{iz} \frac{dz}{\left( 1 + \frac{a}{2} \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \right)^n} \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{1}{i} \oint_{\lvert z \rvert=1} \frac{z^{n-1} \,dz}{\left( \frac{a}{2} z^2 + z + \frac{a}{2} \right)^n} \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{1}{i} \left( \frac{2}{a} \right)^n \oint_{\lvert z \rvert=1} \frac{z^{n-1} \,dz}{\left( \left( z - \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1-a^2}}{a} \right) \left( z - \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1-a^2}}{a} \right) \right)^n} \\
&amp;amp;= 2\pi \left( \frac{2}{a} \right)^n \frac{1}{(n-1)!} \left. \frac{d^{n-1}}{dz^{n-1}} \left( \frac{z^{n-1}}{\left( z - \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1-a^2}}{a} \right)^n } \right) \right\rvert_{z = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1-a^2}}{a}},
\end{align}
by Cauchy's integral formula. For the sake of simplifying notation, we
substitute \(w = z - \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1-a^2}}{a}\), giving us
\begin{align}
&amp;amp;\phantom{ {}={} } 2\pi \left( \frac{2}{a} \right)^n \frac{1}{(n-1)!} \left. \frac{d^{n-1}}{dz^{n-1}} \left( \frac{z^{n-1}}{\left( z - \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1-a^2}}{a} \right)^n } \right) \right\rvert_{z = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1-a^2}}{a}} \\
&amp;amp;= 2\pi \left( \frac{2}{a} \right)^n \frac{1}{(n-1)!} \left. \frac{d^{n-1}}{dw^{n-1}} \left( \frac{\left(w + \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1-a^2}}{a} \right)^{n-1}}{ w^n } \right) \right\rvert_{w = \frac{2\sqrt{1-a^2}}{a}} \\
&amp;amp;= 2\pi \left( \frac{2}{a} \right)^n \frac{1}{(n-1)!} \left. \frac{d^{n-1}}{dw^{n-1}} \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{k} \left( \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1-a^2}}{a} \right)^k w^{-k-1} \right) \right\rvert_{w = \frac{2\sqrt{1-a^2}}{a}} \\
&amp;amp;= 2\pi \left( \frac{2}{a} \right)^n \frac{1}{(n-1)!} \left. \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-1}{k} \frac{(-1)^{n-1} (n-1+k)!}{k!} \left( \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1-a^2}}{a} \right)^k w^{-k-n} \right\rvert_{w = \frac{2\sqrt{1-a^2}}{a}} \\
&amp;amp;= 2\pi \left( \frac{2}{a} \right)^n (-1)^{n-1} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{(n-1+k)!}{k!k!(n-1-k)!} \left( \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1-a^2}}{a} \right)^k \left( \frac{2\sqrt{1-a^2}}{a} \right)^{-k-n} \\
&amp;amp;= 2\pi (-1)^{n-1} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{(n-1+k)!}{k!k!(n-1-k)!} \left( \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1-a^2}}{2} \right)^k \left( \sqrt{1-a^2} \right)^{-k-n}.
\end{align}
We then have
\begin{align}
I_n &amp;amp;= \left( \sqrt{1-a^2} \right)^{2n-1} 2\pi (-1)^{n-1} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{(n-1+k)!}{k!k!(n-1-k)!} \left( \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1-a^2}}{2} \right)^k \left( \sqrt{1-a^2} \right)^{-k-n} \\
&amp;amp;= 2\pi \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{(n-1+k)!}{k!k!(n-1-k)!} \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{1-a^2}}{2} \right)^k \left( -\sqrt{1-a^2} \right)^{n-1-k}.
\end{align}
Again, for the sake of simplifying notation, let \(x = \sqrt{1-a^2}\). Notice
that there very well may be terms of odd powers of \(x\), so we have no
indication yet that the resulting value will end up being a polynomial in
\(a\). We then have
\begin{align}
&amp;amp;\phantom{ {}={} } 2\pi \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{(n-1 + k)!}{k!k!(n-1 - k)!} \left( \frac{1 + x}{2} \right)^k (-x)^{n-1 - k} \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{2\pi}{2^{n-1}} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \sum_{j=0}^k \frac{(n-1 + k)!}{k! (n-1 - k)! j! (k - j)!} (-2)^{n-1 - k} x^{n-1 - k + j}.
\end{align}
Rearranging with \(k' = n-1 - k\) and  \(j' = k' + j = n-1 - k + j\), and
then swapping the sums, we have
\begin{align}
&amp;amp;\phantom{ {}={} } \frac{2\pi}{2^{n-1}} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \sum_{j=0}^k \frac{(n-1 + k)!}{k! (n-1 - k)! j! (k - j)!} (-2)^{n-1 - k} x^{n-1 - k + j} \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{2\pi}{2^{n-1}} \sum_{k'=0}^{n-1} \sum_{j'=k'}^{n-1} \frac{(2(n-1) - k')!}{(n-1 - k')! k'! (j' - k')! (n-1 - j')!} (-2)^{k'} x^{j'} \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{2\pi}{2^{n-1}} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} x^j \sum_{k=0}^j \binom{2(n-1)-k}{n-1} \binom{n-1}{j} \binom{j}{k} (-2)^k,
\end{align}
where in the last step \(k\) and \(j\) are written in place of \(k'\) and
\(j'\) for convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we apply the Egorychev method. Up until this point I'd been in a mad dash
to get rid of the integral as quickly as possible, and then simplify as much as
possible, but then I was blocked by a binomial sum I couldn't handle. The
Egorychev method involves introducing complex contour integrals to simplify
binomial identities, which seems a little backwards – after all, didn't we
just work so hard to get rid of a contour integral in the first place? Well,
let's see what this method really does.  Our main tool is the following
identity:
\[
\binom{s}{t} = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{\lvert z \rvert = \varepsilon} \frac{(1+z)^s \,dz}{z^{t+1}}
\]
There are other possible integrals we could use to express binomials, but this
will suffice for this problem. My main intuition here for why we would ever
want to substitute this is that binomials are nice in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each individual binomial is pretty arithmetically: 
\(\binom{s}{t} = \frac{s!}{t!(s-t)!}\).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Binomials combine to be pretty algebraically: 
\(\sum_{t=0}^s \binom{s}{t}z^t = (1+z)^s\) is the simplest example, and we
can think of generating functions more generally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are nice ways combinatorially to think about binomials using both these
facts simultaneously, but here we're stuck with individual binomials in a sum
that doesn't allow them to play nicely off of each other, especially because of
this nasty \( (-2)^k \) term. We'd like to be able to take advantage of
property 2, which is what the Egorychev method affords us. Applying the method
to the binomial \(\binom{2(n-1)-k}{n-1}\) gives us
\begin{align}
&amp;amp;\phantom{ {}={} } \sum_{k=0}^j \binom{2(n-1)-k}{n-1} \binom{j}{k} (-2)^k \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2\pi i}  \sum_{k=0}^j \oint_{\lvert z \rvert = \varepsilon} \frac{(1+z)^{2(n-1)-k} \,dz}{z^n} \binom{j}{k} (-2)^k \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2\pi i}  \oint_{\lvert z \rvert = \varepsilon} \frac{1}{z^n} (1+z)^{2(n-1)-j} \sum_{k=0}^j \binom{j}{k} (1+z)^{j-k} (-2)^k \,dz \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{1}{2\pi i}  \oint_{\lvert z \rvert = \varepsilon} \frac{1}{z^n} (z+1)^{2(n-1)-j} (z-1)^j \,dz \\
&amp;amp;= \sum_{k=0}^j \binom{2(n-1)-j}{n-1 - k} \binom{j}{k} (-1)^k,
\end{align}
giving us the identity
\[
\sum_{k=0}^j \binom{2(n-1)-k}{n-1} \binom{j}{k} (-2)^k = \sum_{k=0}^j \binom{2(n-1)-j}{n-1 - k} \binom{j}{k} (-1)^k.
\]
This is considerably nicer. In particular, look what happens when \(j\) is
odd! By pairing the terms up by \(k\) and \(j-k\), we have
\[
\binom{2(n-1)-j}{n-1 - k} \binom{j}{k} (-1)^k + \binom{2(n-1)-j}{(n-1) - (j-k)} \binom{j}{j-k} (-1)^{j-k} = 0,
\]
so therefore
\[
\binom{n-1}{j} \sum_{k=0}^j \binom{2(n-1)-j}{n-1 - k} \binom{j}{k} (-1)^k
\]
is \(0\) for odd \(j\)! Then we have
\[
I_n = \frac{2\pi}{2^{n-1}} \sum_{\substack{j \in [0, n-1], \\ 2 \mid j }} \left( 1-a^2 \right)^{j/2} \binom{n-1}{j} \sum_{k=0}^j \binom{2(n-1)-j}{n-1 - k} \binom{j}{k} (-1)^k,
\]
which is indeed a polynomial in \(a\), as desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect that someone more clever than I could manage to get from the first
contour integral to the last without evaluating the former and reintroducing
the latter or establish the binomial sum identity using purely elementary
means, since as much of a nuisance exponentials are, \(2\) is still a very
nice number. Whether or not the Egorychev method is necessary for this problem
specifically, I felt that this problem served as a neat introduction to its
concept and set me up to explore more substantive applications of the Egorychev
method in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">A couple weeks ago my friend Ross sent me an interesting integral involving a neat trick called the Egorychev method.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A N G E R Y</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/posts/2017/06/28/angery/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A N G E R Y" /><published>2017-06-29T10:50:00+07:00</published><updated>2017-06-29T10:50:00+07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/posts/2017/06/28/angery</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/posts/2017/06/28/angery/">&lt;p&gt;angery &amp;gt;:(&lt;/p&gt;

I
remember writing that I liked my initials: &quot;SCH&quot; were the first three leters of
&quot;school,&quot; and I liked school. You get the picture: I've always been a pretty
lame kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have several names. I am Samuel Chen Hsiang, born Samuel Chen Xiang. Most
people call me Sam or Samuel, though to my family and oldest friends I'm Sammy.
But I am also 项莅山, in pinyin &lt;em&gt;Xiàng Lìshān&lt;/em&gt;. In traditional my name is
項蒞山, and in my family's dialect, Ningbonese, my name is pronounced more like
&lt;em&gt;Hong Lihseh&lt;/em&gt;. My Chinese nickname is 山山, which in Mandarin comes out to
&lt;em&gt;Shanshan&lt;/em&gt;, and in Ningbonese &lt;em&gt;Sehseh&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't intend for this blog to contain too many personal posts, but I feel
that a page hosted under a domain that is precisely my name warrants some
discussion of that name. What does it mean to me? What do any of these names
mean to me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My last name is my father's, and sharing this name with my family ties us
together as a unit. My parents and older sister have been the most important
positive influences on my life, and my last name serves as a fitting reminder
of that fact. My parents changed the spelling of our family name when they were
naturalized. The uninitiated used to call me &lt;em&gt;Zyang&lt;/em&gt;; now, they hiss at me. I'm
also presumed Taiwanese-American. Everything's in good spirits though; nobody's
at fault except for Wade and Giles!&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; My current last name has, however,
provided me one benefit: I escaped the glut of Wangs and Zhangs that crowd the
end of graduation roll call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's not uncommon to take great pride in a last name. A man remembers his
father and his grandfather and hears stories from generations past passed down
through that name. For better or worse, I don't felt strongly about my name's
history. I never knew my paternal grandfather, and I sure couldn't care less
for a [ruthless general][xiang-yu] who lived 2000 years ago. The romanization
of my name means nothing to me; after all, I've had two, and no one is more
special than the other. Although some people chance upon others with their same
last name and bond over it, I've never met anyone with the same Chinese
character.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; My father had a professor in college with the same family name,
but that's as much luck as we've had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;项莅山 is my Chinese name. My given name reflects my birthplace, among the
Allegheny Mountains. &quot;Having mountains and water&quot; is my mother's favorite
criterion for the beauty of a nature. I write in simplified Chinese, so I don't
place much value in 蒞山, though in my father's ancestral village the character
項 was painted on a giant stone in proud traditional. Since I don't speak a
lick of Ningbonese, no one in my life has called me &lt;em&gt;Hong Lihseh&lt;/em&gt;, though my
older relatives still refer to me affectionately as &lt;em&gt;Sehseh&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My middle name is a token from my mother. I am no less my mother's son than my
father's son, and I think it's arbitrary that my father's name takes
precedence. But it is proper that my mother's family name, not my Chinese name,
has legal meaning; indeed, I am more my mother's son than I am Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a shame that hyphenated last names become a mess after just two
generations. If I'm lucky enough to have children, I would prefer to defer the
choice of family name to the mother, or even to a coin flip. Certainly there
are more pressing issues in society than last name precedence; after all, a
name is just a symbol. But it is certainly the most powerful one.&lt;/p&gt;
