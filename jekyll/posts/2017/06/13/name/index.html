    <p>In my first grade class, everyone wrote a journal entry about their name. I
remember writing that I liked my initials: "SCH" were the first three leters of
"school," and I liked school. You get the picture: I've always been a pretty
lame kid.</p>

<p>I have several names. I am Samuel Chen Hsiang, born Samuel Chen Xiang. Most
people call me Sam or Samuel, though to my family and oldest friends I'm Sammy.
But I am also 项莅山, in pinyin <em>Xiàng Lìshān</em>. In traditional my name is
項蒞山, and in my family's dialect, Ningbonese, my name is pronounced more like
<em>Hong Lihseh</em>. My Chinese nickname is 山山, which in Mandarin comes out to
<em>Shanshan</em>, and in Ningbonese <em>Sehseh</em>.</p>

<p>I don't intend for this blog to contain too many personal posts, but I feel
that a page hosted under a domain that is precisely my name warrants some
discussion of that name. What does it mean to me? What do any of these names
mean to me?</p>

<p>My last name is my father's, and sharing this name with my family ties us
together as a unit. My parents and older sister have been the most important
positive influences on my life, and my last name serves as a fitting reminder
of that fact. My parents changed the spelling of our family name when they were
naturalized. The uninitiated used to call me <em>Zyang</em>; now, they hiss at me. I'm
also presumed Taiwanese-American. Everything's in good spirits though; nobody's
at fault except for Wade and Giles!<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> My current last name has, however,
provided me one benefit: I escaped the glut of Wangs and Zhangs that crowd the
end of graduation roll call.</p>

<p>It's not uncommon to take great pride in a last name. A man remembers his
father and his grandfather and hears stories from generations past passed down
through that name. For better or worse, I don't felt strongly about my name's
history. I never knew my paternal grandfather, and I sure couldn't care less
for a [ruthless general][xiang-yu] who lived 2000 years ago. The romanization
of my name means nothing to me; after all, I've had two, and no one is more
special than the other. Although some people chance upon others with their same
last name and bond over it, I've never met anyone with the same Chinese
character.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> My father had a professor in college with the same family name,
but that's as much luck as we've had.</p>

<p>项莅山 is my Chinese name. My given name reflects my birthplace, among the
Allegheny Mountains. "Having mountains and water" is my mother's favorite
criterion for the beauty of a nature. I write in simplified Chinese, so I don't
place much value in 蒞山, though in my father's ancestral village the character
項 was painted on a giant stone in proud traditional. Since I don't speak a
lick of Ningbonese, no one in my life has called me <em>Hong Lihseh</em>, though my
older relatives still refer to me affectionately as <em>Sehseh</em>.</p>

<p>My middle name is a token from my mother. I am no less my mother's son than my
father's son, and I think it's arbitrary that my father's name takes
precedence. But it is proper that my mother's family name, not my Chinese name,
has legal meaning; indeed, I am more my mother's son than I am Chinese.</p>

<p>It's a shame that hyphenated last names become a mess after just two
generations. If I'm lucky enough to have children, I would prefer to defer the
choice of family name to the mother, or even to a coin flip. Certainly there
are more pressing issues in society than last name precedence; after all, a
name is just a symbol. But it is certainly the most powerful one.</p>

      <p>Not even their fault either, since pinyin is no less quirky for an English speaker; however, more people are used to it. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
