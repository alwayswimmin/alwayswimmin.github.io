        <p>Dynamic programming can turn exponential solutions into polynomial solutions,
but it can also help turn factorial solutions into exponential. Problems where
the bound on $n$ is 20, for example, signal that an exponential solution is the
one required. Consider <a href="http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&amp;cpid=494">the following

        <p>I knew I belonged in Harvard Glee Club when we sang a TTBB arrangement of
Palestrina's <em>Sicut cervus</em> at the first rehearsal freshman year. The text is
an adaptation of Psalm 42:<sup id="fnref:1"></sup> <em>Sicut cervus desiderat ad fontes aquarum, ita
desiderat anima mea ad te, Deus</em>. The sheet music we were using had a typo in
the English translation, using <em>heart</em> instead of <em>hart</em><sup id="fnref:2"></sup> as the translation
for <em>cervus</em>. Interestingly, just as <em>hart</em> and <em>heart</em> sound similar, so do
<em>cervus</em> and the Latin word for <em>heart</em>, <em>cor</em>,<sup id="fnref:3"></sup> and even more
interestingly, this is not a coincidence.</p>

        <p>Today, Republicans announced the Health Care Freedom Act, notably removing the
individual and employer mandates from the Affordable Care Act. By removing the
requirement for people to have insurance, Republicans tout this bill as
restoring choice to the American consumer, thereby reducing healthcare prices.
This sounds like music in a speech: health insurance providers still can't
discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions, but now consumers are
not forced to pay for insurance they don't want! This seems like a double-win
for the American people.</p>

<p>Here's the catch: not only will a skinny repeal not lower costs, it's actually
much worse than having Obamacare repealed entirely.</p>

        <p>To what extent should people be able to control their futures, and to what
extent can the government take that away? Last week, Jacob and I were
discussing whether the government has done too little or too much in shaping
our life decisions. The United States gives its citizens plenty of agency in
weighing the short and long term. I can choose what food I eat and how much I
exercise, as it's entirely my decision whether having a satisfying but
unhealthy lifestyle is worth shaving years off the end of my life. I assess
risk constantly, from inching closer to the edge of a cliff for that perfect
photo to simply biking to and from work, internalizing the probability that I
get into an accident. I can choose my career: some jobs are more financially
risky while some are physically more dangerous, some better fit my skill set
while others I find more intrinsically appealling, but the government leaves
all of these factors up to the market to set prices and wages, and from there I
make my own choice.</p>

allies with good intent ought not march.</p>
